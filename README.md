# Ticky

My solution to the final project of the Using Python to Interact with the Operating System course (Course 2 of the IT Automation with Python Specialization)

## What it does
- Uses regular expressions to parse a log file
- Appends and modifies the info from the log file into two dictionaries
    - Sorts the first dictionary based on the occurrences of an error (From most common to least common)
    - The second dictionary stores each user with the amount of errors and info they logged, this is sorted by username
- Generates two CSV files from the dictionaries
